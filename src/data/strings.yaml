        I'm a 25 years old developer from Uruguay who has been interested in programming since young.
        I had my first contact with the world of programming at the age of 12 and I began to learn how to
        program for real at the age of 15 thanks to the help of 2 friends who taught me about
        open source software. From there I was totally self-taught and I was learning a variety of topics
        that interested me until I got to know everything I know today.

        My favorite programming languages at the time of writing this are Rust, TypeScript and Elixir,
        and I'm interested in learning other new technologies when I have the
        motivation and time to do so. I like to keep up to date at least with theoretical knowledge about
        new and interesting things.

        I would like to redesign this page when I have time and also add more personal things about me but
        for now it fulfills its role of introducing me. If you want to know more about me, let's chat.
